# MongoDB

## Overview

For today's assignment, you will be connecting your front end to an Express server. This Express server will connect to a Mongo database. You will need to make a "schema" to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate this database with some of your favorite books so that when the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results in the database. Your front end will display these results.

## Feature Tasks

See the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/qgaCsVVa) for your feature tasks for today's lab.

## Documentation

You must have a complete `README.md` for your repository.

_Your `README.md` must include:_

```md
# Project Name

**Author**: Team Member Names Goes Here
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
```

## Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

```markdown
Name of feature: ________________________________

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____
```

Add this information to your README.

## Submission Instructions

1. Complete your Feature Tasks for the lab, according to the Trello cards.
